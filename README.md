## :page_facing_up: About
- A TicTacToe game where you take turns clicking in the game interface to try and get 3 in a row to win.

## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
- Initially make pseudocode to work through the app functionality and plan how to make it work.

- Set up a baseplate page for it to work on with a simple playing grid without having it display as a single line across the top of the page.
- Struggled to code in a way to prevent the user/s from adding more X's or O's after one player had won, initially thought to remove the on-click functionality, but ended up resolving the issue by implementing code that prevented the on-click from running if a player had won.
- Had an issue where I wasn't able to clear the classes or remove the content from the playing grid, I was checking through the source pages on the browser to see if my code had an error, and found that the variables for the playing grid weren't global variables, so I had to simply make them global variables and my reset buttons started working as intended.
- Checking for a player win was running many repetitive checks to test every possible solution, I struggled to find a way that I could rewrite the check so that it would be less repetitive. I eventually found a way to write it so it only performs most of the checks if a certain prerequisite is met beforehand.
- A bug in the code that caused the game board to break and disappear, went through a number of tests, including checking the target of what you click and checking the conditions for players to add their piece to the game board. Eventually found the issue which was that the parathesis around the player's click target conditions was missing, causing the program to bypass one of the other conditions and allow you to unintentionally alter the core page layout.

## :rocket: Cool tech
- Created with html, css and javascript.
- Once a player wins it is announced on the page.
- Counters for player X and player O to display how many times each has won.
- Displays which player's turn it is.
- Buttons to reset the scores and/or the game board.
- Plays quiet ambient music in the background when the user interacts with the page.

## :beetle: Bugs to fix
- Currently no known bugs.

## :notebook: Lessons learnt
- Instead of trying to remove a class from an object to fix it running when its not supposed to, I learned to instead find a way to make its run condition false.

## :white_check_mark: Future Features
- No current planned future features.
